# Compilers
## Compilation Process
- **[[Lexical Analysis]]**
	- Divides the program into "tokens", similar to words in natural language.
	- Tokens include: variable names, keywords, math + logic operators, literals
- **Parsing**
	- Understanding the structure of a program as a hierarchical tree
- **Semantic Analysis**
	- Understanding the Meaning of the program
	- Compilers are capable of limited semantic analysis, i.e. handling scoping rules and types
- **Optimisation**
	- Automatically modifying the program to increase speed and decrease memory use
	- Compiler needs to know rules for which optimisations it can do
- **Code Generation**
	- Produce the machine code or intermediate language
