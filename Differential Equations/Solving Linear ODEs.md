# Solving Linear ODEs
## General Solution
- The general solution for a Linear DE is
- $$y = y_c + y_p$$
- where $y_c$ is the complimentary function, and $y_p$ is the particular integral
## Example
$$
\begin{gather*}
\text{The differential equation } x \dv {y} {x} + y = \ln x \text{ is defined for } x \gt 0\\
\text{a) Find the complimentary function} \\
\text{b) A particular integral has the form } y = a \ln x + b \text{ Find the values of a and b} \\
\text{c) hence find the particular solution with the initial condition } y = 3 \text { when } x = 1

\end{gather*}
