# Auxiliary Equation
$$a \dv[2]{x}{y} + b \dv{x}{y} + cy = 0$$
Is a homogenous 2nd order differential equation with constant coefficients.
The auxiliary equation to this ODE is:
$$a \lambda^2 + b\lambda +c =0$$
If this equation has real distinct roots $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, then the solution to the ODE is:
$$y = Ae^{\lambda_1 x} + Be^{\lambda_2 x}$$
## Example
$$\text{Solve the differential equation } \dv[2]{x}{y} - 3 \dv{x}{y} + 2y = 0$$
$$\text{Given that } y = 1 \text{ and } \dv{y}{x} = 0 \text{ when } x = 0$$
